Hello,

I am a private English teacher.  I have experience in teaching for over 12 years.  I have my degree in Communications and my TESOL certification.  I have an affordable English learning package for sale.  For every 30 minute lesson on any thing you want to learn - for example, conversation, conjugation, grammar, etcetera, it will cost $300.00 per month USD for 5 classes a week.  Classes for ages 5 to adult.

Classes will be booked fast so please direct message me for serious inquiries.  

Let us spread the knowledge of English to make your global business more lucrative.

Thank you

Teacher Chiara
